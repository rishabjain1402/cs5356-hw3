            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Rishab Jain! I am a current ORIE (Operations Research and Information Engineering) student at Cornell Tech, 
                pursuing my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning. I come from a Civil Engineering background, where I worked 
                extensively with analytical problem-solving, physics, and statistics.</p>
        
            <p>This webpage is a quick biography of my life, highlighting my career, friends, family, and hobbies. I hope you enjoy 
                getting a glimpse into my journey. Thanks for checking out my page!</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>I have experience in project management within the infrastructure industry, where I worked on large-scale projects 
            involving scheduling, budgeting, and workforce management. Through my internships, I had the opportunity to contribute 
            to some amazing sites like the Queensboro Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge, gaining hands-on experience in operations 
            and coordination.</p>

            <p>My interest in the operations side of engineering led me to study ORIE at Cornell Tech, where I have worked with real-world datasets and helped make data-driven decisions for companies. While I have 
            a strong passion for integrating technology with engineering consulting, I am currently looking to gain experience in 
            Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering roles to continue developing my expertise in this field.</p>

                <p>This is me on the Queensboro Bridge, where I spray-painted my initials. I explored the details HTML element, which allows users to interact with hidden content without using JavaScript. It works by wrapping extra information inside details, with summary acting as the clickable element. I used it to make images interactive—when clicked, which reveal additional context. This feature keeps my webpage clean while making it more engaging.</p>

        <!-- Family Section -->
        <section id="family">
            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>I come from a family of six, including my amazing dog, Nova. Family has always been an important part of my life, and I would like to share it with you. Below I have attached a photo of my dog alongside a selfie 
            with my siblings at a Big Time Rush Concert.</p>

                <p>This is a close up of my dog, Nova. He is now 5 years old, and I got him once I left for college - which was upsetting. He is quite chunky now and lazy, but he is still a very happy dog. </p>

        <section id="friends">
            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>I've added photos of my friends from all stages of life—elementary school, high school, undergrad, and now Cornell. 
                Each group has played a big role in shaping who I am, and I'm grateful for the lifelong connections I've made along the way.</p>
        
            <p>I've also included my boxing team, a group of guys I've grown incredibly close with through training, sparring, and pushing 
                each other to be better every day. These guys have supported me through all my fights, and I couldn't have done it without them.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of training and work, I love spending time with my friends, whether it's hitting the bars, raving at concerts, or just unwinding with some Xbox sessions. No matter the setting, these friendships bring a lot of fun and energy to my life.</p>

                    <p>This picture was taking at a NYC rave called EZOO. I went with those high school friends in 2024. It was disappointing because the Friday show got canceled, and we had to pay more to go to the Saturday event instead - regardless it was still fun!</p>

        <!-- New Features Section -->
        <section id="new-features">
            <h2>New Features I Looked Into Outside of Class</h2>
            <p>I looked into “details” for a new feature not discussed in class. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> HTML element allows users to toggle hidden content without needing JavaScript. I implemented this feature by wrapping extra information inside the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag, with the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element acting as the clickable area. This was applied to images on my website, allowing users to click on a photo to reveal additional context. This feature enhances interactivity and user engagement while keeping the webpage clean and organized. This feature could be used outside of images as well, which includes hovering over text to reveal longer passages.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, I explored two new CSS features: frosted glass effect (<code>backdrop-filter</code>) and animation (<code>@keyframes</code> for shake effect). The frosted-box effect was applied to the "About Me" section, giving it a semi-transparent, blurred background – making it seem more of a clean UI look. This was done using <code>backdrop-filter: blur(10px);</code> which enhances the visual aesthetics by making the section appear like frosted glass. I also added a shake animation using <code>@keyframes</code>, making images shake slightly when hovered over. This was done by using small <code>translateX()</code> movements that alternate back and forth, creating an effect when users interact with images. These two features improve both design and user interaction without requiring Java.</p>

            <p>I want to make note that the floating animated shapes were coded using LLMs. I do not want this part of the code to be counted towards the assignment for CSS implementation – I did this more for personal enjoyment and to test out the CSS capabilities without JavaScript.</p>
