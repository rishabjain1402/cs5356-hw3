            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Rishab Jain! I am a current ORIE (Operations Research and Information Engineering) student at Cornell Tech, 
                pursuing my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning. I come from a Civil Engineering background, where I worked 
                extensively with analytical problem-solving, physics, and statistics.</p>
        
            <p>This webpage is a quick biography of my life, highlighting my career, friends, family, and hobbies. I hope you enjoy 
                getting a glimpse into my journey. Thanks for checking out my page!</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>I have experience in project management within the infrastructure industry, where I worked on large-scale projects 
            involving scheduling, budgeting, and workforce management. Through my internships, I had the opportunity to contribute 
            to some amazing sites like the Queensboro Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge, gaining hands-on experience in operations 
            and coordination.</p>

            <p>My interest in the operations side of engineering led me to study ORIE at Cornell Tech, where I have worked with real-world datasets and helped make data-driven decisions for companies. While I have 
            a strong passion for integrating technology with engineering consulting, I am currently looking to gain experience in 
            Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering roles to continue developing my expertise in this field.</p>

                <p>This is me on the Queensboro Bridge, where I spray-painted my initials. I explored the details HTML element, which allows users to interact with hidden content without using JavaScript. It works by wrapping extra information inside details, with summary acting as the clickable element. I used it to make images interactive—when clicked, which reveal additional context. This feature keeps my webpage clean while making it more engaging.</p>

        <!-- Family Section -->
        <section id="family">
            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>I come from a family of six, including my amazing dog, Nova. Family has always been an important part of my life, and I would like to share it with you. Below I have attached a photo of my dog alongside a selfie 
            with my siblings at a Big Time Rush Concert.</p>

                <p>This is a close up of my dog, Nova. He is now 5 years old, and I got him once I left for college - which was upsetting. He is quite chunky now and lazy, but he is still a very happy dog. </p>

        <!-- Friends Section -->
        <section id="friends">
            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>I've added photos of my friends from all stages of life—elementary school, high school, undergrad, and now Cornell. 
                Each group has played a big role in shaping who I am, and I'm grateful for the lifelong connections I've made along the way.</p>
        
            <p>I've also included my boxing team, a group of guys I've grown incredibly close with through training, sparring, and pushing 
                each other to be better every day. These guys have supported me through all my fights, and I couldn't have done it without them.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of training and work, I love spending time with my friends, whether it's hitting the bars, raving at concerts, or just unwinding with some Xbox sessions. No matter the setting, these friendships bring a lot of fun and energy to my life.</p>

                    <p>This picture was taking at a NYC rave called EZOO. I went with those high school friends in 2024. It was disappointing because the Friday show got canceled, and we had to pay more to go to the Saturday event instead - regardless it was still fun!</p>
