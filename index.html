        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rishab Jain! I am a current ORIE (Operations Research and Information Engineering) student at Cornell Tech, 
            pursuing my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning. I come from a Civil Engineering background, where I worked 
            extensively with analytical problem-solving, physics, and statistics.</p>
    
        <p>This webpage is a quick biography of my life, highlighting my career, friends, family, and hobbies. I hope you enjoy 
            getting a glimpse into my journey. Thanks for checking out my page!</p>

        <h2> Career </h2>
        <p>I have experience in project management within the infrastructure industry, where I worked on large-scale projects 
        involving scheduling, budgeting, and workforce management. Through my internships, I had the opportunity to contribute 
        to some amazing sites like the Queensboro Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge, gaining hands-on experience in operations 
        and coordination.</p>

        <p>My interest in the operations side of engineering led me to study ORIE at Cornell Tech, where I have worked with real-world datasets and helped make data-driven decisions for companies. While I have 
        a strong passion for integrating technology with engineering consulting, I am currently looking to gain experience in 
        Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering roles to continue developing my expertise in this field.</p>

        <h2> Family </h2>
        <p>I come from a family of six, including my amazing dog, Nova. Family has always been an important part of my life, and I would like to share it with you. Below I have attached a photo of my dog alongside a selfie 
        with my siblings at a Big Time Rush Concert<p>

    <section id="friends">
        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <p>I've added photos of my friends from all stages of life - from elementary school, high school, undergrad, and now Cornell. 
            Each group has played a big role in shaping who I am, and I'm grateful for the lifelong connections I've made along the way.</p>
    
        <p>I've also included my boxing team, a group of guys I've grown incredibly close with through training, sparring, and pushing 
            each other to be better every day. These guys have supported me through all my fights and I couldn't have done it without them</p>
    
        <p>Outside of training and work, I love spending time with my friends, whether it's hitting the bars, raving at concerts, or just unwinding with some Xbox sessions. No matter the setting, these friendships bring a lot of fun and energy to my life. I apologize for 
            those who didn't make it in the photos, there was only so much time I wanted to spend on this assignment.
